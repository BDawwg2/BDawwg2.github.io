        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>This week marked the beginning of my web design journey. I was excited to learn and explore the world of web design. The instructor introduced us to the course, and we got to know our classmates during a brief online orientation. I was eager to dive into the subject matter and start developing my skills.</p>

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>This week, we delved into the history of web design, focusing on the period from 1990 to 1998. I personally really liked the old retro style Operating systems of windows 95’ and 98’. We were also briefed assignment 1 and 3 and began planning about my persona and the other things required with it like their goals, demographic, and barriers they may face.</p>

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>Continuing our exploration of web design history, we studied the period from 1998 to 2008. I thought St George’s crypt was a cool website and really liked its visual narrative and storytelling. We also did work Venn Diagrams for project 1 knowing the user goals design goals and the shared goals.</p>

    <div id="Week 4" class="entry">
        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>This week, we focused on web design history from 2009 to the now. I thought that the website shown was very fun and bight with cool interactions. I thought that it was good to learn about the customer journey map and user flow concepts even though I already had some experience with it from past courses. I did the quiz and got 80/100 this time.</p>
