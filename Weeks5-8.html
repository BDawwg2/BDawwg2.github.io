        <h2>Week 5: My Journal Entry</h2>
        <p>This week’s lesson was mostly on help with assignment. I liked how animated the Surfe site was and how when you scroll it seems like you are looking through files. </p>

        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p>This week, we delved into the visual aspects of web design. The Timex site was alright more of a Casio person myself, but Timex is the official watch of the UFC according to commentator Jon Anik. We explored colour theory, typography. We were shown the different paths we could take with the assignment, and I had chosen to do a website about finding yourself as the persona I had was always someone else and never themselves. I drew out sketches and did some basic wireframing on figma..</p>

        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p>We discussed composition in web design, and I learned about the importance of visual hierarchy and alignment. The concept of affordances, which relates to how users perceive interactive elements, was fascinating. I can see how these principles can greatly impact the usability of a website. The site of the day was interesting, I still don’t really under stand what the product their selling is but it seems like a coffee/tea without any stimulant.</p>

        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <p>This week, we were given options for our second assignment. I chose to work with Content Management Systems (CMS) for my project. I tried using web flow at first however it didn’t want to listen to me and I got mad as switched to Editor X which worked similarly to figma which made using it a lot easier. The site of the week was fairly slow but everything did work. I liked how the more your scroll down the words change from translucent to opaque. I really like the old arcade games like the OG streetfighter games.</p>
