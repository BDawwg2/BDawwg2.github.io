        <p>We delved into creating responsive websites, ensuring that web designs adapt to different screen sizes. File organization became essential to maintaining a structured and manageable project. I like the start of the site where the panels fall like dominoes. I liked the images that they used to display their products as well as the colours they used to make it more proffessionsal.</p>

        <p>We focused on content this week, which is a critical element of web design. I also evaluated my progress on assignment 2.2. I realize I need to make a few adjustments to the project CMS. I thought the site of the day was alrigtht and liked how even though the articles/stories where all different sizes everything was contained in a grid.  </p>

        <p>Overall, I was very happy with what the course provided, and what I learnt. CMS was a new topic for me, and I think learning it was a valuable skill. I thought that my prior coding experience would be more helpful throughout the trimester but that wasnâ€™t really the case as I ended up forgetting most of it. Despite not actually being able to attend due to a clash the course has been a fun learning experience.</p>
